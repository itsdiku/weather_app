# README

This is simple api based Rails application.

This rails app doesn't have active record as its an external api based website.

This is a bit overkilled for a rails app with using the active record, but I justed wanted to test how a rails app can handle external api calls.

Feel free to copy the code.

rapidapi has been used as an external api.
